    <h2>Carbon Budget Accounting</h2>
    <p>Climate targets imply a <span class="tooltip" title="The amount of CO‚ÇÇ emissions that can be released globally while limiting warming to a given threshold.">finite carbon budget</span>. Companies must track how quickly they're using their share of this limit.</p>
    <p>Imagine a company with a 50 Mt CO‚ÇÇ budget over 20 years. If it emits 4 Mt annually, it's using up 8% each year ‚Äî exhausting the budget too quickly. This should be treated like asset depletion.</p>
    <p>Carbon budget accounting proposes a <strong>‚Äúcarbon depletion expense‚Äù</strong> on the income statement. This reflects the economic or environmental cost of emissions tied to a company‚Äôs allowed future.</p>
    <div class="note">
      Treating CO‚ÇÇ like a finite asset aligns sustainability reporting with climate science. It also alerts investors to future constraints.

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Let‚Äôs look at how this framework applies to three real companies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Freeport-McMoRan:</strong> Traditional miner. In 2023, sustainable profit dropped by nearly $1B once user cost was deducted.</li>
      <li><strong>Anglo American:</strong> Mixed signals. High reinvestment in Quellaveco mine but still low diversification into renewables.</li>
      <li><strong>√òrsted:</strong> Transitioned fully from fossil fuels to offshore wind. CapEx in green projects near 100%, with strong reinvestment and minimal depletion cost.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples show how sustainable accounting <strong>reshapes financial perception</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Policy Implications & Recommendations</h2>
    <p>This framework reveals <strong>real gaps</strong> in today‚Äôs financial reporting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Traditional profit may conceal value destruction via resource or carbon depletion.</li>
      <li>Supplementary statements (e.g., ‚ÄúSustainable Income Statement‚Äù) should be introduced.</li>
      <li>Standard-setters could integrate user cost and carbon budgeting into ESG disclosures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Call to action:</strong> Accountants, investors, and policymakers must rethink income. Sustainable accounting is not just ethics ‚Äî it‚Äôs accuracy.</p>
    <div class="note">
      Adopting these reforms helps avoid ‚Äústranded assets,‚Äù supports climate goals, and improves long-term financial integrity.
